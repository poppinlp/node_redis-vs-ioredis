# node_redis-vs-ioredis

There are two popular redis client for Node: [node_redis](https://github.com/NodeRedis/node_redis) and [ioredis](https://github.com/luin/ioredis).

This repository is a simple performance benchmark for them. PR is welcomed to makes this not tooooo simple >.<

## About this benchmark

First of all, I must say ioredis is a real full-featured redis client right now. This is a really big PRO.

I have no malice for both libraries. Just wanna do a performance benchmark.

## Run

1. Use `git clone git@github.com:poppinlp/node_redis-vs-ioredis.git` to clone this repo to local.
1. Use `yarn` or `npm i` to install dependencies.
1. Use `redis-server` to start redis server local with no password. (or `docker compose up -d`)
1. Use `yarn benchmark` or `npm run benchmark` to start benchmark.

## Result

I do this benchmark on my laptop with:

-   OS: macOS 10.14.6
-   Processor: 2.7 GHz Intel Core i7
-   Memory: 16 GB 2133 MHz LPDDR3

And the result is like:

It will also output an average for both ioredis and node_redis as well as a "winner".

### Command line arguments

This benchmarking tool accepts following CLI arguments:

-   `--length [int]` The length of the benchmark (default: `20000`)
-   `--datafile [filepath]` A custom JSON file to use for testing. Has to have a `string`, `number` and `hash` property which are the only ones processed.
